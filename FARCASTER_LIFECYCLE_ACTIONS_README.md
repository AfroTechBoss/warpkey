# Farcaster Mini App Lifecycle Actions

This document explains the implementation of Farcaster's SDK lifecycle actions in WarpKey, providing deeper integration with Farcaster's UI pathways and enhanced user experience.

## Overview

WarpKey now implements key Farcaster Mini App lifecycle actions that allow users to:
- Add WarpKey to their Farcaster app collection
- Share enhanced casts tied to their Farcaster identity
- Access context-aware features when launched from Farcaster

## Implemented Lifecycle Actions

### 1. `sdk.actions.addMiniApp()`

**Purpose**: Prompts users to add WarpKey to their Farcaster app collection for easy access.

**Implementation**:
- Available only when WarpKey is launched within Farcaster
- Displays as "⭐ Add WarpKey to Collection" button
- Provides one-click addition to user's mini app collection

**User Experience**:
```typescript
const handleAddToCollection = async () => {
  try {
    await addMiniApp()
    alert('WarpKey has been added to your Farcaster collection! 🎉')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to add to collection:', error)
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced `sdk.actions.composeCast()`

**Purpose**: Builds Cast-to-Sign flows and prompts broadcasts tied to Farcaster identity.

**Implementation**:
- Multiple cast templates (transaction, achievement, share, custom)
- Automatic embed generation for transaction hashes
- Context-aware messaging based on user activity

**Cast Templates**:

#### Transaction Casts
```typescript
// Automatically generated when users complete transactions
const transactionCast = `📤 Just sent 0.1 ETH on Base using @warpkey

via Uniswap
Seamless wallet experience

https://warpkey.app

Tx: 0x1234...5678`
```

#### Achievement Casts
```typescript
// Generated based on user session statistics
const achievementCast = `🎉 Achievement unlocked with @warpkey!

✅ Successfully connected to 3 dApps
💰 Managed transactions across 6 networks
🔐 Secure Web3 experience on Farcaster

#WarpKey #Web3Achievement`
```

#### Share Casts
```typescript
// Promotional content for WarpKey
const shareCast = `Just discovered @warpkey - the ultimate Web3 wallet for Farcaster! 🔑

✨ Seamless dApp connections
🔒 Secure transaction signing
🌐 Multi-network support

The future of Web3 UX is here! #WarpKey #Web3 #Farcaster`
```

## Context Detection

### `isInFarcaster` State

WarpKey detects when it's running within Farcaster and adapts the UI accordingly:

```typescript
const initializeFarcaster = async () => {
  try {
    const context = await sdk.context
    setIsInFarcaster(!!context)
    
    if (context?.user) {
      await loadUserData(context.user)
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to initialize Farcaster SDK:', err)
  }
}
```

**Features Available Only in Farcaster**:
- Add to Collection button
- Enhanced cast composer with embeds
- Automatic session initialization
- Context-aware messaging

## User Interface Integration

### Main Interface Enhancements

1. **Collection Management**:
   - "⭐ Add WarpKey to Collection" button (Farcaster-only)
   - One-click addition to user's mini app collection

2. **Enhanced Cast Actions**:
   - "📢 Share WarpKey" - Promotional content
   - "🎉 Share Achievement" - Session-based achievements
   - Grid layout for better UX

3. **Session-Aware Features**:
   - "📱 Session History" - View past activity
   - "🔗 Cast to Sign" - Share transaction details

### Cast-to-Sign Component

Enhanced with:
- Automatic transaction hash embeds
- Multiple blockchain explorer support
- Context-aware message generation
- Session integration for tracking shared casts

```typescript
// Automatic embed generation
const explorerUrls = {
  'ethereum': 'https://etherscan.io',
  'base': 'https://basescan.org',
  'optimism': 'https://optimistic.etherscan.io',
  'arbitrum': 'https://arbiscan.io',
  'polygon': 'https://polygonscan.com',
  'zora': 'https://explorer.zora.energy'
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

```typescript
const openCastComposer = async (options: CastComposerOptions = {}) => {
  try {
    if (!isInFarcaster) {
      throw new Error('Cast composer is only available within Farcaster')
    }

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      throw new Error('User must be authenticated to open cast composer')
    }

    return await sdk.actions.composeCast(options)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to open cast composer:', err)
    setError('Failed to open cast composer')
    throw err
  }
}
```

### User Feedback

- Clear error messages for failed operations
- Success confirmations for completed actions
- Loading states during async operations
- Fallback UI for non-Farcaster environments

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Seamless Integration**: Native Farcaster experience
2. **Easy Access**: Add to collection for quick launches
3. **Social Sharing**: Share achievements and transactions
4. **Context Awareness**: Personalized experience based on Farcaster identity

### For Developers
1. **Deep Integration**: Leverage Farcaster's UI pathways
2. **Enhanced Discovery**: Collection feature increases app visibility
3. **Social Amplification**: Built-in sharing mechanisms
4. **User Retention**: Seamless re-engagement through Farcaster

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "@farcaster/miniapp-sdk": "latest"
}
```

### Key Files Modified
- `contexts/FarcasterContext.tsx` - Added lifecycle actions
- `app/page.tsx` - Enhanced UI integration
- `components/ui/cast-to-sign.tsx` - Improved cast composer

### Environment Detection
```typescript
// Check if running in Farcaster
const context = await sdk.context
const isInFarcaster = !!context
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Track cast performance and engagement
2. **Custom Templates**: User-defined cast templates
3. **Batch Operations**: Share multiple transactions in one cast
4. **Channel Integration**: Post to specific Farcaster channels
5. **Notification System**: Alert users of successful shares

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Launch WarpKey from Farcaster
2. Verify "Add to Collection" button appears
3. Test cast composer with different templates
4. Confirm transaction embeds work correctly
5. Validate error handling for non-Farcaster environments

### Integration Testing
- Farcaster SDK integration
- Cast composer functionality
- Embed generation
- Session tracking
- Error boundary testing

This implementation provides a comprehensive integration with Farcaster's ecosystem, enhancing user experience and providing deeper pathways into Farcaster's UI.
